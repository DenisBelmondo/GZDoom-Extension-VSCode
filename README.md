# ZScript-VSCode
## GZDoom's ZScript language support for VSCode.
For now, it just highlights stuff.

Made with the help from: marrub--'s ZScript documentation, and my other highlighter for Kate (the text editor from KDE).

## HOW DO I USE IT?
### PREREQUISITES
- Visual Studio Code

### FOR VERSIONS <= 0.9.0
- Get the .vsix from the "Releases" page
- Open VSCode
- Press "Ctrl + Shift + p"
- Type "Extension: install from VSIX"

### FOR VERSIONS 1.0.0
Just do the same thing for earlier versions
OR:
Get it from Visual Studio's Marketplace
